# Some boring dice game

My father introduced this game at a family party. I was bored pretty
soon - so I decided to program the very same game to show how little
player decisions are needed, and how meaningless your score is.

The points you gain and lose have nothing to do with the decisions
you made beforehand - there is just one optimized way of decision
making, so I hard coded it into the game.

As a result, the only choice which players have in this game is to
say how many people are in the game - afterwards it is just a lot of
pressing "Enter".

Don't take it personal, Dad^^ but Tichu is just way better.
